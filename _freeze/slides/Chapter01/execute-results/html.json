E.g.,\n\n-   recording the number of heart beats per minute\n-   counting birds in your yard\n-   measuring the lengths of fish you catch\n\nEach time you collect one of these observations, it is likely to be different.\n\n-   Pulse may vary between 55 and 70 bpm, depending on when you record it\n-   Number of birds varies at different times, and across different yards.\n\nWe call these **random variables** (often denoted with an upper case letter, $X$), because the particular value that a single observation or measurement will take is uncertain. The value varies across observations.\n\n## Types of data\n\n![](img/data_types.png){.preview-image}\n\n## Subtypes of *qual*itative data\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n<br>\n\n-   **Nominal variables** have no particular order <br>(e.g., gender, colour, species, country)\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n\n-   **Ordinal variables** can be ordered <br>(e.g., altitude = {low, mid, high}, <br>age group = {child, juvenile, adult} )\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](img/birds.jpg) ![](img/good_bad.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Subtypes of *quant*itative data\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n<br>\n\n-   **Continuous variables** have no gaps between possible values, as in measurements (e.g., weight, temperature, length)\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n-   **Discrete variables** have gaps between possible values, as in counts (e.g., number of siblings, number of flowers)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](img/ruler.jpg) ![](img/abacus.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Subtypes of continuous data\n\n<br>\n\n### Interval scale\n\n-   No absolute zero\n-   Division & subtraction may not be meaningful\n-   Temperature in degrees Celcius is interval because 20°C is not twice as hot as 10°C.\n\n<br>\n\n### Ratio scale\n\n-   Zero = zero\n-   All arithmetic manipulation can be done\n-   Length is ratio because 20 mm is twice as long as 10 mm.\n\n## Data Collection: Survey, Experiment, Census \n\n::::{.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"65%\"}\n\n-   We collect data from the world to get information about patterns and processes. \n\n-   Most datasets contain a subset, a **sample**, of a much bigger population of interest.\n      \n      +   We may conduct a **survey** to collect a sample of data from different places, times, people, or organisms. We would rarely survey all of them.\n      \n      +   We might conduct an **experiment** where we take a sample of elements (people, organisms, objects) and apply some **treatment** in a lab (e.g., drug, temperature, exercise regime, or other treatment) to study its effects.\n\n-   If we are not dealing with a sample, if *every* element of the population of interest is represented in the dataset, we call this a **census** rather than a **sample**. \n\n:::\n\n:::{.column width=\"35%\"}\n\n![](img/sampling_variation2.gif)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Measurement issues\n\n-   Measuring Devices or Instruments\n\n    -   a physical device - measuring rule to gauge the heights of plants\n    -   a counting device - a Geiger- counter for measuring radioactive material\n    -   a questionnaire - requires a more subjective response.\n\n-   Measurement Error\n\n    -   measuring instrument may be *faulty* (bias)\n    -   values recorded from the same object may vary from one measurement to another (variance)\n\n-   Indirect measures\n\n    -   For example, we use Body Mass Index (BMI) as a measure of condition, and we measure temperature with the expansion of mercury.\n\n## Non-response\n\n-   a *non-sampling error*\n\n-   **Selection stage:** an element may be selected but not found\n\n    -   e.g. sheep in a flock may be tagged with individual identification number but one may not be found at the time of the survey.\n\n-   **Collection stage:** it may not be possible to take a measurement\n\n    -   some respondents may forget, or refuse, to answer the questionnaire\n\n-   **Documentation stage**\n\n    -   Incorrect record of measurement\n\n-   **Call-backs** reduce non-response\n\n## Census related concepts\n\n**TARGET POPULATION** the population under study\n\n**FRAME** operationalises data collection from a target population. e.g. listing of elements in population.\n\n**ACTUAL POPULATION** is the resulting set of elements on which usable data have been collected.\n\n![](img/census.jpg)\n\n## Sample *vs* population\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"55%\"}\n-   A **sample** is a subset of the population.\n\n-   Datasets usually only contain a sample from the population; rarely do we have the entire population of data!\n\n-   Why sample?\n\n    -   Sampling conserves resources (money, time, etc.).\n    -   A well collected sample is more useful than a badly designed census.\n    -   Collecting data may be destructive.\n    -   The disadvantage: the statistics we calculate from sample data is subject to ***sampling variation**, which introduces* uncertainty\\* about their true values.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![](img/samuel_johnson.jpg)\n\n> \"*You don't have to eat the whole ox to know that the meat is tough*\"<br> -- Samuel Johnson (1709-1784)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Population, frame, and sample\n\n![](img/sample.jpg)\n\n## Statistical inference\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n[***Statistical inference*** is the process of using information from sample data to make conclusions about the population.]{style=\"color:#E46C0A;\"}\n\n<br>\n\nFor example, we want to know $\\mu$, mean length of fish in a population. So, we collect a sample of fish, measure their lengths, calculate the mean $\\bar{x}$, and use $\\bar{x}$ as an estimate of $\\mu$. This is *statistical inference*.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/inference.png)\n:::\n:::\n\nThe sample mean $\\bar{x}$ depends on *which particular fish we happened to get in our sample*.\n\nTherefore, the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ itself is a random variable.\n\nIf we were to take 1000 different samples, we'd get 1000 different means.\n\n## Bias *vs* sampling variance\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nA method used to estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ a population parameter $\\theta$ is called an ***estimator***. An estimator includes the study design, methods of data collection, and mathematical operations.\n\n***Sampling variance*** is the sample-to-sample variation in an estimator.\n\n***Bias*** is when our estimator *doesn't get it right on average*. That is, the average of estimates over $\\infty$ samples is not centred on the population parameter; $\\text{Mean}(\\hat{\\theta}) \\neq \\theta$.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/bullseye.png)\n:::\n:::\n\nAn estimator can have high/low sampling variance and high/low bias.\n\n## Principle of randomisation\n\n::::{.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=\"65%\"}\n\n-   We want our sample to be representative of (and have similar properties to) the population. The most straightforward way to do this is through *randomisation*.\n\n-   We randomise the selection of objects for our sample to avoid **bias**. If we (consciously or subconsciously) tended to chose the largest fish for our sample, we'd get an upwardly biased estimate of the lengths.\n\n-   Simple random sampling or *EPSEM* (equal probability of selection) is the gold standard of random sampling.\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"35%\"}\n![](img/rolling-dice.jpg)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Simple Random Sampling (SRS)\n\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   **Random selection of elements** \n\n    -   \"Random\" refers to the *process* not *outcome*\n    -   Each (sampling) unit has same chance of being selected\n    -   Units can be selected with & without replacement\n\n\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/random_sample.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n-   SRS is easy to handle; suits even for a poor sampling frame\n\n-   SRS can be costly to implement\n\n-   SRS estimates are more variable than some alternatives\n\n:::{.absolute top=270 right=50 style=\"font-size: 50%;\"}\n[Smith et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02821)\n:::\n\n\n## Stratified Random Sampling (STRS)\n\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n-   Suitable for *heterogeneous* populations\n\n-   Population is divided into relatively homogeneous groups called *strata* and a random sample is taken from each *stratum*.\n\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/stratified_sample.png)\n:::\n::::\n-   Sampling Approaches\n\n    -   Sample the larger strata more heavily (suits when all the strata are equally variable)\n    -   Sample the more varied strata are sampled\n\n-   Advantages of STRS\n\n    -   leads to efficient estimation That is, the variance (of an estimate) is usually less than that of SRS\n    -   sample is spread throughout population\n\n:::{.absolute top=270 right=50 style=\"font-size: 50%;\"}\n[Smith et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02821)\n:::\n\n## Cluster sampling\n\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   A convenient method of sampling\n\n-   population is composed of *clusters* (groups)\n\n-   Select certain clusters (randomly) and collect measurements from a random selection of the elements within the chosen clusters\n\n-   Larger variance than SRS!\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/cluster_sample.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n:::{.absolute top=270 right=50 style=\"font-size: 50%;\"}\n[Smith et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02821)\n:::\n\n## Systematic Random sampling (SyRS)\n\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n-   Select every $k^{th}$ element!\n\n-   Random start within the first block of elements.\n\n    -   Convenient and also the sample will be representative of population\n\n    -   Variance of estimates - generally greater than those of SRS\n\n    -   Inefficient/inappropriate, if cycle or trend is present\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/systematic_sample.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n:::{.absolute top=270 right=50 style=\"font-size: 50%;\"}\n[Smith et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02821)\n:::\n\n## Other Sampling methods\n\n-   Probability proportional to size (PPS)\n    -   e.g., sampling high-value companies more likely than low-value companies\n-   Multistage\n    -   e.g., first stage - cluster; second stage - SRS\n\n-   Non-probability sampling methods\n\n    -   Haphazard / opportunistic / volunteer; take what you can get! \n    -   Snowball; get your participants to find new participants\n    -   Purposive; select items with certain characteristics; e.g., patients with particular symptoms\n\n-   Non-probability samples are often treated as random, requiring the assumption that the sample is representative. The validity of this assumption should be carefully considered.\n\n## Some sampling methods\n\n![](img/1_5.png)\n\n## Effective Sample size (thumb rule)\n\n| Sample Design | Design Effect ($d$) | Effective Sample Size ($\\frac{n}{d}$) |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| SRS           | 1.00                | $n$                                   |\n| STRS          | 0.80 to 0.90        | $\\frac{n}{0.9}$ to $\\frac{n}{0.8}$    |\n| Cluster       | 1.02 to 1.26        | $\\frac{n}{1.26}$ to $\\frac{n}{1.02}$  |\n| SyRS          | 1.05                | $\\frac{n}{1.05}$                      |\n| Quota         | 2                   | $\\frac{n}{2}$                         |\n\n## Summary\n\n-   Issues to address\n\n    -   WHAT are collected?\n    -   WHO does the data collection?\n    -   HOW are the data collected?\n\n-   Bias occurs due to\n\n    -   SELECTION\n    -   COLLECTION\n    -   NON-RESPONSE (the single largest cause of bias!)\n\n-   A sample may have the same biases as a census along with *sampling errors*\n\n<!-- ricomisc::rstudio_viewer(\"Chapter-1.html\", file_path = NULL) -->\n",
